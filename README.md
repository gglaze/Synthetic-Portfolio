The synthetic benchmark consists of 100% long the Vanguard Admiral Value Fund.  Then, add to its return (75% of the spread between the V A Value - V A Growth).  So if in one year the Value generated 8% and the spread was a negative 2%, the total return is 6.50%.

Compare the annual returns since 2000 of the synthetic benchmark compared to returns of the S&P 500.

Derive the alpha & beta of the synthetic benchmark since 2000. Pay special attention to the beta.

Next determine the standard deviation & Sharpe ratio of both the synthetic benchmark & the S&P 500 since 2000.

Also derive the skew & kurtosis of the synthetic benchmark and S&P 500 since 2000.  Evaluate distribution normality.
